    <h1>Subic & Spanish Influence</h1>
  </nav>

  <main>
    <section class="card">
      <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Spanish colonization of the Philippines combined imperial expansion and Christian evangelization. While early efforts focused on Manila and Cavite, late 19th-century geopolitical pressures elevated Subic Bay due to its deep-water harbor, superior to Cavite Navy Yard. Spanish influence in Subic Bay rested on four pillars: military outposts, missions, governance, and land use, with administrative and social structures preceding major military infrastructure by over a century. Legal frameworks like the Regalian Doctrine and reducción reshaped land rights and indigenous systems, impacts still evident today.</p>

      <h2>II. Geopolitical Foundation: Subic Bay as a Coastal Outpost</h2>
      <p>Subic Bay’s strategic potential was recognized early by Juan de Salcedo and formalized around 1800 with initial fortifications. In 1884, a Royal Decree declared it a naval port, and the Arsenal de Olongapo was authorized in 1885. The Spanish Gate remains a tangible relic of this military investment. During the Spanish-American War, Spanish forces failed to fully leverage the bay’s defensive potential, allowing American forces to occupy and later expand the naval facility.</p>

      <h2>III. Religious and Social Architecture</h2>
      <p>Christian missions were central to colonial control, with the Augustinian Recollects establishing Olongapo in 1750. Reducción centralized indigenous populations into towns like Olongapo under church-centered layouts, enforcing social and religious control through policies such as Bajo de Campana. The military Arsenal was strategically integrated with this pre-existing settlement, ensuring labor and administrative support.</p>

      <h2>IV. Governance: Local Administration and Enforcement</h2>
      <p>Local elites (Principalía) executed colonial authority. The Gobernadorcillo combined administrative, judicial, and religious duties, including enforcing tribute and corvée labor. This system funded infrastructure like the Arsenal while institutionalizing resource extraction and social control.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>V. Land Tenure: The Regalian Doctrine</h2>
      <p>The Regalian Doctrine declared all land crown-owned, replacing communal indigenous stewardship. This legal framework enabled the Spanish Crown to allocate land for the Arsenal and underpinned subsequent military and colonial developments. Its effects persist, contributing to ongoing land disputes for indigenous communities such as the Aeta.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>VI. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Spanish colonial policies in Subic Bay created an integrated system of social, legal, and military control. Religious and administrative mechanisms prepared the population and labor for the Arsenal de Olongapo. The American occupation inherited this strategic and institutional foundation, demonstrating continuity from Spanish to U.S. control. Spanish legacies remain visible in landmarks, Catholic culture, and contested land rights, illustrating the enduring impact of colonial policy on contemporary governance and social justice.</p>
