    <h1>The American Naval Era: Olongapo & Subic Bay</h1>
  </nav>

  <main>
    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>From 1901 to 1992, the U.S. Navy’s presence at Subic Bay shaped Olongapo and Zambales politically, economically, and socially. The base, a logistics hub and R&R center for the Seventh Fleet, transformed Olongapo from an agrarian town into a modern city reliant on military employment, peaking at ~15,000 local workers. The era ended after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption and the Philippine Senate’s rejection of a lease extension.</p>
      <p>The conversion of the base into the Subic Bay Freeport Zone (SBFZ) quickly attracted nearly US$1.3 billion in investment and 11,821 jobs by 1995. Yet, the era left enduring social scars, notably ~50,000 marginalized Filipino Amerasians, labeled "Iniwan ng Barko" due to U.S. immigration exclusions.</p>

      <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Subic Bay’s strategic importance predates U.S. rule, recognized by the Spanish with the 1885 Olongapo Arsenal. The U.S. formalized its presence in 1901, governing Olongapo directly until 1959, shaping its urban layout and services, but limiting local autonomy.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. Strategic Significance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Base Establishment:</strong> Chosen for deep-water anchorages despite Army opposition, becoming the largest U.S. base in Asia.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Framework:</strong> The 1947 Military Bases Agreement sparked sovereignty debates; Philippine amendments in 1956 affirmed nominal sovereignty but allowed U.S. operational control.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Conflicts:</strong> Key in WWII, Korea, and Vietnam, supporting logistics, ship repairs, and R&R for personnel.</li>
        <li><strong>Modern Re-engagement:</strong> EDCA (2014) allows limited U.S. access amid South China Sea tensions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Economic Impact</h2>
      <p>The base drove Olongapo’s economy, infrastructure, and population growth. Paternalistic governance ensured utilities, schools, and hospitals, but fostered dependency. Employment peaked at ~15,000, and Subic became a global logistics hub.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Social Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>The R&R economy created vibrant, sometimes exploitative entertainment and sex industries. During Marcos’ era, state policies encouraged such growth to attract U.S. currency, affecting at least 15,000 women.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>6. Base Closure (1991-1992)</h2>
      <p>Pinatubo’s eruption and nationalist politics prompted the abrupt U.S. withdrawal. The sudden exit displaced thousands and ended the primary economic driver, forcing a rapid national strategy for economic recovery.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>7. Transition to SBFZ</h2>
      <p>The Philippine government, via SBMA and World Bank support, converted the base into a commercial hub. By 1995, the Freeport hosted 201 firms, created 11,821 jobs, and attracted US$1.3 billion in investment, shifting economic reliance from the U.S. to diverse sectors like manufacturing and tourism.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>8. Amerasian Legacy</h2>
      <p>Filipino Amerasians face social stigma, unemployment, and exclusion from U.S. immigration laws, a legacy of the base’s social dynamics. The "Iniwan ng Barko" narrative highlights both individual abandonment and institutional neglect.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The American Naval Era brought modernization, economic growth, and strategic value but imposed sovereignty costs, economic dependency, and social stigma. The SBFZ demonstrates successful post-base adaptation, leveraging inherited infrastructure. Subic Bay’s strategic geography ensures its continued relevance in U.S.-Philippine relations, requiring careful balance of national, economic, and military interests.</p>
