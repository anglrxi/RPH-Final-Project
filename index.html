            <p>
              Olongapo City is a highly urbanized city located in the province of Zambales, Philippines. Historically, it served as a strategic site due to its proximity to Subic Bay, which became a major U.S. naval base for nearly a century. Today, Olongapo is known for its vibrant community, economic development, and as the gateway to the Subic Bay Freeport Zone, a hub for commerce, industry, and tourism.
